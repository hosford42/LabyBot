# LabyBot
A pure Python text-interface clone and solver of the Laby game

NOTE: The modules will still work, but some of the tests will fail without the original Laby levels. You'll need to create a symlink to them. You can find them [here](https://github.com/sgimenez/laby/tree/master/data/levels).
