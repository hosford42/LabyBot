# LabyBot
*A pure Python, text-interface clone and solver of the Laby game*

## What's it for?

This package has a couple of purposes:

* To demonstrate how *modeling* the environment makes it easy to implement 
  planning and reasoning.
* To provide a useful toy problem for testing out other AI algorithms.

**NOTE**: The modules will still work, but some of the tests will fail without 
the original Laby levels. You'll need to create a symlink to them. You can 
find them [here](https://github.com/sgimenez/laby/tree/master/data/levels).
